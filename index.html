      <h4>Here's some Talking Heads</h4>
      <p class="description-box">Ah, watch out
        You might get what you're after
        Cool babies
        Strange but not a stranger
        I'm an ordinary guy
        Burning down the house
        Hold tight
        Wait 'til the party's over
        Hold tight
        We're in for nasty weather
        There has got to be a way
        Burning down the house
        Here's your ticket, pack your bags
        Time for jumpin' overboard
        Transportation is here
        Close enough but not too far
        Maybe you know where you are
        Fightin' fire with fire
        Ah, all wet
        Hey, you might need a raincoat
        Shakedown
        Dreams walking in broad daylight
        365 degrees
        Burning down the house
        Ah, it was once upon a place
        Sometimes I listen to myself
        Gonna come in first place
        People on their way to work
        And, baby what do you expect?
        Gonna burst into flames, ah
        Burning down the house
        My house
        Is out of the ordinary
        That's right
        Don't wannna hurt nobody
        Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
        Burning down the house
        No visible means of support
        And you have not seen nothin' yet
        Everything's stuck together
        And I don't know what you expect
        Staring into the TV set
        Fightin' fire with fire, ah</p>
        <h4>Here's some more Talking Heads</h4>
        <p class="description-box">And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
          And you may find yourself in another part of the world
          And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
          And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
          And you may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"
          Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
          Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
          Into the blue again, after the money's gone
          Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
          And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"
          And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"
          And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"
          And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"
          Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
          Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
          Into the blue again, after the money's gone
          Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Water dissolving and water removing
          There is water at the bottom of the ocean
          Under the water, carry the water
          Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean
          Water dissolving and water removing
          Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
          Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
          Into the blue again, into the silent water
          Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
          Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
          Leting the days go by, water flowing underground
          Into the blue again, after the money's gone
          Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
          You may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"
          You may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"
          And you may ask yourself, "Am I right, am I wrong?"
          And you may say to yourself, "My God, what have I done?"
          Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
          Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
          Into the blue again, into the silent water
          Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
          Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
          Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
          Into the blue again, after the money's gone
          Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Same as it ever was, look where my hand was
          Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
          Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (I couldn't get no rest)
          Same as it ever was, hey let's all twist our thumbs
          Here comes the twister
          Letting the days go by (same as it ever was, same as it ever was)
          Letting the days go by (same as it ever was, same as it ever was)
          Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down
          Letting the days go by, water flowing underground</p>
